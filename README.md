## Socioeconomic-country-clustering
Unsupervised machine learning project to cluster countries based on socioeconomic and health indicators. Built for identifying regions in critical need of aid.


### Project Overview
This project was developed for **HELP International**, a global humanitarian NGO focused on poverty alleviation and disaster relief. With recent funding of **$10 million**, the NGO wants to **strategically identify countries most in need of aid** based on socio-economic and health indicators.

As a data analyst, our role is to cluster countries using these indicators and recommend the most vulnerable countries requiring immediate support.

### Key Visuals & Techniques

- Elbow Method for optimal K in K-Means
- Dendrograms for hierarchical clustering
- Cluster scatter plots using key variables
- Boxplots to compare cluster distributions
